 * Take a walking tour with SF City Guides - http://www.sfcityguides.org/. All tour guides are local (often retired and been living in the city for many years) and they give you all the local history of a neighbourhood. They are basically free but wth a $5 or $10 tip at the end of it for the guide. My favourite walks include Mission Murals, Tastes and Tales of North Beach (http://www.sfcityguides.org/desc.html?tour=115), Popos (can't seem to find this tour listed currently though).
